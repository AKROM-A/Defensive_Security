**Q1. File -> Github.txt:**   
**What is the API key the insider added to his GitHub repositories?**

Opening the zip, we found 3 files github.txt, office.png, and Webcam.png. In the Question Earlier it told us to open the GitHub.txt, inside the file, we can see a Github link https://github.com/EMarseille99. Q1 wants us to explore the Repositories, so I did and I found **"Login Page.js"** on the first Repository, and so we got our answer for Q1.
